# SouthernAfrica_PopSize_V_Technology
This repository contains R quarto documents/scripts used to reconstruct and test the relationship between prehistoric population size and the development of stone technology in Holocene Southern Africa.

There are two files in this repository: _Radiocarbon_data_uncalib.csv_ and _Population_V_Technology.qmd_

_Radiocarbon_data_uncalib.csv_ contains information on the archaeological sites (site), latitude (lat), longitude (lon), country, biome, uncalibrated radiocarbon date (Date), radiocarbon uncertainty (Uncertainty), and technology industries (Technological Complex) that I examined.

_Population_V_Technology.qmd_ is a quarto document that can be opened in R and compiled into PDF. This file has code for the figures that I created for the paper.
